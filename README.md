# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Task Requirements :

1. Display all the existing API data in UI using Axios
2. Users should be able to perform CRUD operations on user data, including adding, editing, and deleting user records.
3. The user data should be stored in a mock API that can be accessed using Axios fetch.
4. The UI should have a clean and responsive design that is easy to use and navigate

# How To Use :
